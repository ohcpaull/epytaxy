# Overview

Valanoorlabs or vlabs is a python software package to read and analyse datafiles that is typically seen in the Thin Film Functionality (TFF) research group. This includes instruments within our lab, other specialised labs we access, as well as national research infrastructure. The package is split into 3 sections:

1. Scanning probe microscopy
    - Asylum Cypher single-frequency piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM)
    - Asylum Cypher Dual-Amplitude Resonance Tracking (DART) PFM
    - Bruker multimode AFM and PFM
2. X-ray scattering
    - X-ray reflectometry (XRR)
    - X-ray diffraction line-scan (XRD)
    - X-ray reciprocal space map (RSM)  
3.  Neutron scattering
    - TAIPAN triple-axis spectrometer
